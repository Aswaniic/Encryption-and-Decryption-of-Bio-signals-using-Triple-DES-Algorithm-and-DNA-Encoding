# Encryption and Decryption of Bio-signals using Triple-DES Algorithm and DNA Encoding
Triple DES algorithm in CBC mode of operation with DNA encoding and keys generated using Hash Function.
# Language
Python 3.10 is used to implement the algorithm
# Usage
The code works with both image and data file.
If u want to encrypt and decrypt biosignals you need to download python, then pip install pycryptodome in terminal After this  go through the following 2 steps.
1. Choose the file from system folder that you want to encrypt
2. Follow the message boxes that appear in the screen
# Description
Used following python Libraries.
•	 ‘Crypto.cipher’ python library for secure communication
•	 PyCryptodome 3.17 package for cryptographic features such as DES3
•	 PIL Library for image processing
•  hashlib library for generating encryption keys by hash functions.
•	 tkinter library for GUI
